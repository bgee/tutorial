 * @brief This file is the second example of compilation errors and focuses more on class 
 * definitions and pointers.
 * The main idea here is A has a class member B which has a value. A also has two values, one
 * given by the user and the other is fixed. We want to increment B's value with A's two values.
 * The problems in this example are related to: loopy includes, private variables, pointers,
 * casting, conflicting function definitions, default constructors and constants.
